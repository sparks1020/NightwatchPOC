Review of Nightwatch.js
Recently I started building out a new automation framework using Nightwatch.js to dip my toes in automation using Javascript. My previous experience had been solely C# so I wanted to expand my knowledge and explore the new tools out there.
The setup was fairly simple, install and run using NodeJS, configuration was a little confusing but their website details the steps needed. When you get started writing tests, they give you a basic example but if you’re looking to encapsulate pieces of repeat functionality like logging into the application you’re automating or incorporating REST API pieces for creating and deleting users before or after tests, things start to get complicated. I found it confusing to decode the errors spit out in the command line that might reference a specific line of code or might just yell at you and expect you to figure it out.
There are ways to incorporate those custom calls but the documentation and needed hoops to jump through are many and complex. Perhaps if you have been doing Javascript automation or development it would make sense but I had the help of a senior developer well versed in many languages and even he was scratching his head at this setup. Overall, it is much faster and lightweight as compared to frameworks with C# but it has a steep learning curve for writing more complex tests. Without detailed debugging tools or intellisense to help you, it is hard to get up to speed and start writing robust tests quickly.
